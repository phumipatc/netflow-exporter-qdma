 * @param[in] key       The key of the entry. The key width is passed in cam_arg to bcam_create. the key width is
 *                      set using cam_arg_set_key_width. Any contents outside the scope of the key width is ignored.
 *                      The key is assumed to be in little-endian format.

 *                      For bcams using dram , mixed mode is supported.
 *                      This means that a second key width is supported. In addition to the wide regular key width
 *                      specified by cam_arg_set_key_width, a new narrow key width specified by cam_set_narrow_key_width
 *                      is supported. both wide and narrow keys can be inserted in the same bcam.
 *                      Using narrow keys save dram memory, e.g an IPv6 flow can
 *                      be stored as a wide key and an IPv4 flow can be stored as narrow key of half the entry size.
 *                      If the inserted key is wide or narrow is specified by the options argument.
 *
 * @param[in] response  The response of the entry. The response width of the response is the
 *                      same for all functions calls and was originally passed in the cam_arg to
 *                      bcam_create when the instance was created. The response width in cam_arg
 *                      is specified with cam_arg_set_response_width.
 *                      Any contents outside the scope of the response width is ignored.

 *                      response[1] bit 0 is bit 8 of the response and so on.
 *
 * @param[in] ...       This is an optional (variadic) argument available for dram. If the function cam_arg_enable_options was called
 *                      for the cam_arg passed to bcam_create then the options argument must be present in all
 *                      API calls. If cam_arg_enable options was not called, then the options argument must
 *                      not be present in any API calls. The options argument is a pointer to additional control
 *                      arguments which are set using the cam_options_*** functions. Options is copied inside the function and can
 *                      therefore be immediately destroyed after the call.

 * called pos should be set to zero. To find all entries matching the response, the function is

 * For every consecutive call the returned pos value must be used again as an input argument.

 *                                  This efficiently makes cleared bits in the mask to serve
